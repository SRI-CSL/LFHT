\section*{Overview}
For the past month, I've been working on the HeapMetadata project. This report describes the aspects of the project where I've contributed.  I studied the use of caching for performance improvements in metadata lookups.  I investigated the use of Linux tools to allow administrators to partially or completely switch from the original glibc to SRI's glibc. And I wrote an overview of the security features that have been added over the years to {\sf malloc()} implementations from Microsoft and Apple.

\section{Apple and Microsoft}

I authored a separate document which considered the evolution of Microsoft's default allocator in Windows~8 as well as what they're doing in Internet Explorer (completely separate from the default allocator) as well as their EMET5 tool which can be applied to systems as early as Windows~XP. This document also discusses Apple's {\sf libmalloc} and {\sf bmalloc} libraries.
